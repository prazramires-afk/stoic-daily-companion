    title: 'Dichotomy of Control',
    summary: 'Focus only on what you can control — your own actions, judgments, and responses.',
    content: `The foundation of Stoic practice. Epictetus taught that some things are "up to us" (our opinions, impulses, desires, aversions) and some things are not (our body, reputation, position). Happiness comes from focusing entirely on the former.

When you find yourself disturbed, ask: "Is this within my control?" If not, remind yourself that it is nothing to you. If it is, consider what virtue demands of you in this moment.`,

    id: 'impermanence',
    title: 'Impermanence',
    summary: 'All things are temporary. This too shall pass — both pleasure and pain.',
    content: `The Stoics practiced Memento Mori — remembering death — not to be morbid, but to appreciate life fully. Marcus Aurelius constantly reminded himself that emperors and great men are forgotten, that all material things decay.

This awareness liberates us from attachment. It teaches us to cherish what we have now, to act with urgency, and to accept loss with grace. Nothing lasts, and that is precisely what makes each moment precious.`,

    title: 'Virtue as the Highest Good',
    summary: 'The four cardinal virtues — Wisdom, Courage, Justice, Temperance — are the only true goods.',
    content: `The Stoics held that virtue is the only thing that is truly good, and vice the only thing truly bad. Everything else — health, wealth, reputation, pleasure — are "indifferent" (though some are naturally preferable).

**Wisdom** (Sophia): Knowing what is truly good, bad, and indifferent.
**Courage** (Andreia): Facing difficulty and danger for what is right.
**Justice** (Dikaiosyne): Treating others fairly and fulfilling your social duties.
**Temperance** (Sophrosyne): Moderation and self-control in all things.

A life lived according to these virtues is a good life, regardless of external circumstances.`,

  {
    id: 'amor-fati',
    title: 'Amor Fati',
    summary: 'Love your fate. Embrace everything that happens as necessary and good.',
    content: `Beyond mere acceptance, Amor Fati asks us to love our fate — to see everything that happens as fuel for our growth. The obstacle becomes the way. Every setback is training.

This is not passive resignation. It is active acceptance combined with determined effort. You do your best, accept the outcome with grace, and find meaning in whatever occurs. As Nietzsche later expressed it: "My formula for human greatness is amor fati."`,
